                                                    My name is Thaynara, I'm 25
                                                    years old, I've been working
                                                    as a software developer for
                                                    3 years, I was introduced to
                                                    IT when I was 15 years old,
                                                    I started working in a
                                                    department that developed
                                                    defense systems for the
                                                    state, and I fell in love
                                                    with those people writing
                                                    things that I didn't
                                                    understand on that black
                                                    screen, and I decided that
                                                    was what I would do when I
                                                    grew up, years later I
                                                    started at college, but I
                                                    needed to take a break
                                                    because of the covid-19
                                                    pandemic, I went back to
                                                    college in 2021, and started
                                                    in an IT support position at
                                                    an engineering company,
                                                    where I was able to improve
                                                    a lot, and I was promoted to
                                                    Dev, and started working
                                                    with JavaScript.
                                                    After a while I changed
